Ellipsis can help your team be aware of each others’ calendars by adding and viewing events quickly, and by recording and announcing absences in a shared attendance calendar.

Try some of these or type `…help calendar` to see the full list of actions:

- `add lunch at the usual place at 12:30pm to my calendar`
- `what's next on my calendar`
- `…tell everyone I'm away today`
- `who's on vacation today`
