Ellipsis will ask members of a team the 3 classic standup questions and report on them just before the meeting. 

Once this skill is set up, all everyone needs to do is answer the questions asked by Ellipsis and read the summaries sent out.

To set it up, type: `setup classic standup` and answer the questions it asks you.

Enjoy!
