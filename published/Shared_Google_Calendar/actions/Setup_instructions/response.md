**How to set up the Google Calendar skill:**  
This skill requires Google Calendar, and that you already have a single, shared vacation calendar that everyone can access.

To get started, say `setup google calendar`. (I will ask you some questions to set the teamâ€™s shared calendar, and to schedule daily announcements in a particular channel.)

For an introduction to this skill, tell me `calendar help`.
