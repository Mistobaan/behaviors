**Guide to the Shared Calendar skill:**  
Once setup, I will announce the day’s absences at the scheduled time in the selected channel.

**Record absences:**  
- `tell everyone I will be away` — record a new absence, and announce it
- `tell everyone I will be away this Friday`
- `tell everyone I will be away Dec 1 to Dec 7`

**Ask who’s away:**
- `who's away today` — see today’s list of absences
- `who's away next Monday`
- `who's away January 1, 2018`
